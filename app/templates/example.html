  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

  <p>Backbone Boilerplate is the product of much research and frustration. While
  existing boilerplates for Backbone exist, they will often modify the Backbone
  core, don't have an integrated build system, or impose too much on your
  application's structure. This boilerplate attempts to improve that.

  Organize your application in a logical filesystem, and develop Models,
  Collections, Views, and Routers inside modules. Build your application knowing
  you have efficient, compact code. Backbone Boilerplate extends on the
  versatile Backbone core, and helps developers manage their application.</p>

  <h3 id="core-features">Core Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> included.
    <li>Managed filesystem structure for application code, assets, tests, and distribution.
    <li>Snippets to make common tasks easier: modules, HTML5 History API/Hash navigation, template loading and application events.
    <li>Flexible and extendable build system.
      <ul class="nested">
        <li>Concatenate and minify all your libraries, application code, templates and CSS down to reduce transmission time.
        <li>Compile underscore templates to prevent pre-processing on the client.
      </ul>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="writing-app">Writing your application</h2>
  <p>Your application may be made up of third-party libraries, plugins, application code, templates, and lots of logic.  All of this will need
  to be well structured to keep it maintainable and it also needs to be compiled if deployed into production.  Before you can get started you
  will need to clean out all the existing defaults that are in the boilerplate are necessary to display this tutorial.
  </p>

  <h3 id="cleaning">Cleaning out default files and code</h3>
  <p>There are several places where customization may be required.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><h4>Removing the Git history</h4>
      <p>If you cloned the Backbone Boilerplate with Git, you should delete the git directory and then initialize your own Git history:

      <pre><code>
    $ rm -rf .git
    $ git init
      </code></pre>
      </p>

    <li><h4>Removing the test directory</h4>
      <p>If you are not planning on testing your application with QUnit you should delete this directory.</p>

    <li><h4>Removing the build process</h4>
      <p>If you are not planning on using the provided build tool, delete the <code>build</code> folder.  It contains a lot of unnecessary code and
      Node.js modules that you will not need.  You should also clear out the commented out script tags inside of <code>index.html</code>:
      
      <pre><code>
    &lt;!--
         If using the build tool you can uncomment the following lines and use
         these instead.  They will toggle based on if you are using debug or
         release.
    --&gt;

    &lt;!--
    &lt;script src=&quot;/assets/js/libs.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;/assets/js/templates.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;/assets/js/app.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    --&gt;
      </code></pre>
      </p>

    <li><h4>Changing the Favicon</h4>
      <p>At the root level of the project simply change the <code>favicon.ico</code> file to point to your own branded icon.</p>

    <li><h4>Removing default application code</h4>
      <p>This tutorial is rendered in the <code>app/modules/example.js</code> file and written in <code>app/modules/templates/example.html</code>
      both of these files are safe to remove.</p>

    <li><h4>Removing the default routes</h4>
      <p>Routes are defined in the <code>app/index.js</code> file.  Familiarize yourself with it's contents.  You'll notice the default router has two existing rotues and callback defined, reset it to:

      <pre><code>
    // Defining the application router, you can attach sub routers here.
    var Router = Backbone.Router.extend({
      routes: {
        "": "index",
      },

      index: function() {
        // Put your homepage route logic here
      }
    });
      </code></pre>
      </p>


      <p>Above the Router definition you'll see a reference to the example module,
      this is safe to delete as well.

      <pre><code>
    // Include the example module
    var Example = namespace.module("example");
      </code></pre>
      </p>
  
    <li><h4>Removing default assets</h4>
      <p>The default styles for this tutorial are stored in <code>assets/css/style.css</code>.  You will probably want to remove these since they only make sense for this specific page.  They start on line 209.  With the following H5BP header:

      <pre><code>
    /* ==|== primary styles =====================================================
       Author: Backbone Boilerplate <Change to your Name>
       ========================================================================== */
     </code></pre>
     </p>

     <p>You may also want to change the name to yours, if you're planning on putting your custom CSS here as well.</p>

     <p>You should delete the <code>assets/img/backbone.png</code> file if you are not planning on using it in your app.</p>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="namespace">Setting your namespace</h3>

  mynamespace = {
    a: function() {
      
    }
  };
